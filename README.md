This repository contains the text for the *Tiny ES6 Notebook*.

Warning, this is not an introduction to JavaScript. Rather it is a notebook
containing curated examples for JavaScript as well as the new features
found in ES6. It is designed to accompany technical corporate
training offered by the author or aid those who want a quick refresher
to the JavaScript syntax.

Reviews
---------

> that is a good tiny reference book for Javascript - Sebastien

> For those who are catching up on JS https://github.com/mattharrison/Tiny-ES6-Notebook â€¦ thanks @\_\_mharrison\_\_ - @ZoliDay5

Errors

The author is human and will certainly make errors. You may file a bug
